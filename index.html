            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Cleopas Noel Thathapudi (most call me Cleo). At the moment, I am a 14 year old 7th grader. I was born on April 21, 2010 in Benguluru, Karnataka India. I have been learning programming from CodeCademy and the Unity courses for less than a year.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have learned HTML, CSS, git and GitHub, and a little of C++. I am currently learning C#, Python, flask, dom, and Javascript(and whatever is in 7th grade). Through my learning, I have earned many <a href="certificates.html">certificates</a> from Codecademy and Unity so far. However, I have not yet completed many projects. One thing I will be looking forward to do is to attend a game jam.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of my main goals is to be able to learn and understand programming. I am always willing to learn new things and try to improve my skills. Through this, I hope to be able to be a <strong>game developer</strong>.
            </p>
                        
            <p>
                Some of my favorite hobbies are:
                <ul>

                        <strong>BUILDING</strong> with Lego (not playing with it)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Playing video games (favorite game is Forza Horizon 4)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Watching movies (favorite movie is <em>Spider-Man Homecoming</em>)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reading books (favorite book is <em>Kidnapped</em> by Robert Louis Stevenson)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And of course, programming!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                I also have some talents like playng the violin, soccer, and some photo/video editing.
